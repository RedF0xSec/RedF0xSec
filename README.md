## 📂 Projects & Pentesting Reports
Here are some of my projects and security tests:

### 🔹 [CIE-Auth]
📌 **Description:** This project aims to create a secure online auction platform that leverages the Italian Electronic Identity Card (CIE) for user authentication. The system ensures that only verified users can participate in auctions, enhancing security, integrity, and transparency in transactions.

📂 **Technologies:** ECDSA Digital Signatures, Merkle Trees, TLS 1.3 and Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

🛡️ **Focus Areas:** Treat modelling, authentication protocols, cryptographic identity verification, privacy-preserving mechanisms, trusted environments, secure-by-design architecture.

### 🔹 [Penetration Testing Report]
📌 **Description:** This repository contains a detailed **Penetration Test Report** for the **Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Exam** network. The test aims to evaluate the security of internal systems, identify vulnerabilities, and report findings related to flaws such as Remote Code Execution, Token Impersonation, and improper permission assignments.

📂 **Technologies:** Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nikto, Wireshark, Hydra, Netcat, John the Ripper.

🛡️ **Focus Areas**: Red teaming, vulnerability assessment, lateral movement, post-exploitation, internal network compromise.

### 🔹 [AI-Powered Malware Detection System]
📌 **Description:** Malware detection system developed using both Machine Learning (XGBoost) and Deep Learning (MalConv2) approaches. The system was trained on PE files using the SOREL-20M and VirusShare datasets, with in-depth feature selection via SHAP, adversarial robustness evaluation (GAMMA attacks), and defense strategies including Adversarial Training and Focal Loss. Final models achieved strong generalization with recall on malware over 80%.

📂 **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, XGBoost, LIEF, SHAP, Focal Loss, Binary Classification, Grid Search, Adversarial Machine Learning.

🛡️ **Focus Areas**: Static malware analysis, adversarial robustness, interpretability (SHAP), feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, evasion resilience.
